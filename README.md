This GitHub area contains apps and libraries used in the development of apps originally authored by Emerald Sequoia LLC.

The apps are:

*   Emerald Timestamp [`timestamp`]: the single iOS iPhone+iPad app "Timestamp" (Objective-C++)
*   Emerald Observatory [`observatory`]: the single iOS iPad app "Observatory" (Objective-C++)
*   Emerald Chronometer [`chronometer`]:

    *   The iPhone app "Chronometer" (Objective-C++)
    *   The iPad app "Chronomter for iPad" (Objective-C++)
    *   The WearOS app "Chronometer" and its subset apps (Java and C++ via JNI)

The libraries are:

*   `esutil`: A base set of common utilities (including threading) written in C++
*   `estime`: A set of utilities that provide NTP-corrected time
*   `eslocation`: A set of utilities that provide location, either through the device or selected by the user
*   `esastro`: A set of utilities for various astronomical calculations, including a caching manager
